      <h4>Performance obsessed</h4>
    <p>
      Speed is important. So important that you only notice when it isn't there. Ionic is
      built to perform and behave great on the latest mobile devices. With <span class="feature-row-strong">minimal DOM</span>
      manipulation, <span class="feature-row-strong">zero jQuery</span>, and <span class="feature-row-strong">hardware accelerated</span> transitions,

        <h4>Angular &amp; Ionic</h4>
    <p>
      <span class="feature-row-strong">A match made in heaven.</span> Ionic utilizes <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>
      in order to create a powerful SDK most suited to develop rich and robust applications. Ionic not only
      looks nice, but its core architecture is built for <span class="feature-row-strong">serious app development</span>,
      and Angular ties in perfectly.

          <h4>Native focused</h4>
    <p>
      Ionic is modeled on popular native mobile development SDKs, making it easy to understand for
      anyone that has built a native app for <span class="feature-row-strong">iOS</span> or <span class="feature-row-strong">Android</span>. Just drop it in your code to get going,
      and push through <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cordova</a> or
      <a href="http://phonegap.com/" target="_blank">Phonegap</a> when it's ready. <span class="feature-row-strong">Develop once, deploy everywhere</span>.

      <h4>Beautifully designed</h4>
    <p>
      Clean, simple, and functional. Ionic has been designed to work and <span class="feature-row-strong">display beautifully</span> on all current mobile devices. With tons of popular mobile components, typography, interactive paradigms, and a gorgeous (yet extensible) base theme, you'll wonder how you lived without it.

      </div>
      <div class="home_content">
       <h4>A powerful CLI</h4>

With amazing features like Live Reload and integrated logging, you'll already be miles ahead of your native frenemies. Just run <code>npm install -g ionic</code>, and you're good to go!
